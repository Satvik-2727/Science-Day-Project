                    <span>Neptune</span> is a gas giant <span>without</span> a <span>solid surface</span>. Its interior comprises a dense <span>core</span> of <span>rock, metal, and ice</span> surrounded by <span>layers of hydrogen, helium</span>, and other gases. Deep within, extreme pressure and temperatures likely create exotic states of matter. Despite lacking a defined surface, Neptune's atmosphere transitions gradually into its interior, with the atmosphere blending into layers of gas and ice. <span>Magnetic field fluctuations</span> hint at complex internal processes, but due to its distance and the challenges of observation, <span>detailed understanding of Neptune's geology remains elusive.</span></span>

                    <span>Beneath its thick atmosphere, Neptune likely has a small, rocky core surrounded by layers of ice, water, methane, and ammonia. The pressure and temperature within Neptune increase towards its core, creating different states of matter.</span>
