                <span>ATMOSPHERE</span>
                <span><span>Venus's atmosphere</span> is mainly composed of <span>carbon dioxide</span> with traces of <span>nitrogen</span> and <span>sulfuric acid </span> clouds. It's incredibly dense and hot, creating a runaway greenhouse effect. The surface pressure is about <span>92 times that of Earth</span>, equivalent to being nearly a kilometer underwater. Extreme temperatures, averaging <span>462°C (864°F)</span>, result in a harsh environment where lead would melt. High-speed winds reaching <span>360 km/h (224 mph)</span> circulate the planet, contributing to a hostile landscape with corrosive rain and a thick, opaque atmosphere, trapping heat and making it one of the most inhospitable places in the solar system.</span>

                <span>Venus displays a <span>geology</span> shaped by <span>volcanic activity</span> and resurfacing processes. Vast plains, mostly composed of <span>basaltic rock</span>, cover about <span>80%</span> of the surface. Enormous shield volcanoes, such as <span>Maat Mons</span> and <span>Sapas Mons</span>, dot the landscape. Evidence suggests recent volcanic activity and lava flows, indicating a dynamic geological history. Tectonic features like ridges, faults, and fractures span the planet, hinting at <span>past tectonic movement</span>. Impact craters exist, but their scarcity indicates Venus undergoes intense resurfacing, potentially erasing many older geological formations over time.</span>

                <span>COMPOSITION</span>
                <span><span>Venus's composition</span> primarily comprises a <span>rocky mantle</span> and <span>iron-nickel core</span>. Its atmosphere is predominantly <span>carbon dioxide (96.5%)</span> with traces of <span>nitrogen</span> and <span>sulfur dioxide</span>. Thick clouds of sulfuric acid and sulfur dioxide obscure the surface. The <span>surface</span> is mainly <span>basaltic rock</span> with significant volcanic features, suggesting ongoing or recent <span>volcanic activity</span>. The planet lacks water in liquid form due to <span>high temperatures</span>, which caused any ancient oceans to evaporate. Venus's geology and atmosphere make it a scorching, corrosive, and hostile world.</span>
