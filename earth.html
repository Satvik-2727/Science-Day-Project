                    The <span>Earth's atmosphere</span> is a dynamic blanket of gases crucial for life.

Divided into layers— <span>troposphere</span>, <span>stratosphere</span>, <span>mesosphere</span>, <span>thermosphere</span>, and <span>exosphere</span>—it facilitates <span>weather patterns</span>, sustains <span>life</span>, and enables vital processes like <span>photosynthesis</span>. Human activities impact its composition, leading to concerns like climate change and pollution, emphasizing the need for <span>sustainable practices</span> to preserve this delicate <span>balance.</span></span>
