                    Mars has a <span>thin atmosphere</span> composed mostly of <span>carbon dioxide</span> with <span>traces</span> of <span>nitrogen</span> and <span>argon</span>. It's much <span>thinner than Earth</span>'s, creating a harsh environment with <span>extreme temperature variations (-195°C to 20°C)</span> and <span>low atmospheric pressure</span>, equivalent to about <span>1% of Earth</span>'s. Dust storms, prevalent due to fine <span>dust particles</span> suspended in the <span>air</span>, can <span>cover the entire planet</span>, impacting visibility and surface operations. The lack of a strong magnetic field also exposes Mars to harmful <span>solar and cosmic radiation</span>, making it <span>inhospitable</span> for unprotected human habitation.</span>

                    Mars displays diverse <span>geological features</span>. It boasts the <span>tallest volcano, Olympus Mons</span>, and Valles Marineris, a vast canyon system. The planet exhibits <span>evidence</span> of <span>ancient river valleys</span>, indicating past water flow. <span>Sedimentary layers</span> suggest a history of <span>water-related processes</span>. Impact craters, prevalent on its surface, provide insights into its history. The <span>polar ice caps</span> suggest <span>frozen water</span>, while <span>mineral formations</span> hint at past <span>hydrothermal activity</span>. Martian geology, shaped by volcanic activity, water, and impacts, continues to captivate scientists exploring its unique terrain for clues about its geological evolution and <span>potential for past or present life.</span></span>

                    Mars comprises primarily <span>iron oxide</span>, giving it a <span>reddish hue</span>, alongside silicate rocks, basaltic rock formations, and <span>regolith (surface layer)</span> <span>rich in iron, aluminum, and magnesium</span>. Its <span>atmosphere</span> consists mainly of <span>carbon dioxide</span> with <span>trace amounts</span> of <span>nitrogen and argon</span>. <span>Water</span> exists as ice in <span>polar caps</span> and <span>subsurface reservoirs</span>. Additionally, evidence suggests the <span>presence of minerals</span> like hematite, clay, sulfate salts, and perchlorates, indicating <span>past aqueous activity</span>, contributing to ongoing exploration for signs of <span>past or present life</span> on the planet.</span>
