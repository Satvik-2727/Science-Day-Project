                    <span>Pluto's atmosphere</span> is thin, composed mainly of <span>nitrogen</span>, with <span>traces</span> of <span>methane and carbon monoxide</span>. It <span>freezes</span> as Pluto <span>moves away from the Sun</span>, forming a surface ice layer. During its <span>closest approach to the Sun</span>, this ice sublimates, creating a <span>temporary atmosphere</span>. Despite being incredibly thin, it can expand due to <span>seasonal variations</span>, with gases escaping into space. The atmosphere freezes and collapses as Pluto moves farther from the Sun. Its dynamic nature, influenced by Pluto's elliptical orbit, results in a changing and <span>transient atmosphere</span>.</span>

                    <span>Pluto's atmosphere undergoes seasonal changes due to its elliptical orbit and axial tilt, similar to Earth. However, the seasons on Pluto are incredibly long, with each season lasting for several decades due to its long orbital period (about 248 Earth years).</span>

                    <span>Pluto has a thin atmosphere composed mainly of nitrogen (N2), similar to Earth's atmosphere but significantly thinner. The presence of nitrogen and other trace gases like methane and carbon monoxide suggests a complex interplay between the surface and the atmosphere due to processes like sublimation and condensation.</span>
