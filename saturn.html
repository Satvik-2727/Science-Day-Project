                    Jupiter, a <span>gas giant</span>, <span>lacks a solid surface</span> like terrestrial planets. Its structure encompasses a <span>dense core surrounded</span> by <span>metallic hydrogen</span> and <span>liquid hydrogen-helium</span> layers. While lacking conventional geological features, it exhibits diverse <span>magnetic fields</span>, <span>auroras</span>, and a <span>dynamic magnetosphere</span>. Observable features, such as atmospheric bands, storms, and cloud formations, define Jupiter's geophysical characteristics, showcasing its dynamic and <span>intricate atmospheric processes</span> rather than traditional geological formations found on rocky planets.</span>

                <span>
                    <span>Jupiter's composition</span> primarily consists of <span>hydrogen (about 75%)</span> and <span>helium (approximately 24%)</span>. The remaining 1% encompasses <span>trace elements</span> like <span>methane, ammonia, water vapor</span>, and other compounds. Its <span>core</span> likely comprises heavier elements, surrounded by <span>layers of metallic hydrogen</span> transitioning into liquid hydrogen. This gas giant's <span>chemical makeup</span>, dominated by <span>hydrogen and helium</span> with traces of compounds, distinguishes it as a <span>gas-rich celestial body</span>, differentiating it significantly from terrestrial planets in our solar system.</span>
