                <span>
                    <span>Uranus</span> has a <span>gaseous atmosphere</span> primarily composed of <span>hydrogen</span> and <span>helium</span> with <span>traces of methane</span>. Its unique <span>sideways tilt</span> causes <span>extreme seasons</span>, impacting atmospheric dynamics. <span>Winds</span> on Uranus can reach up to <span>560 miles per hour (900 kilometers per hour)</span> in its <span>upper atmosphere</span>, creating distinctive band patterns and massive storms. The <span>methane</span> in its atmosphere <span>absorbs red light</span>, giving Uranus its cyan-blue appearance. The atmosphere also hosts clouds, haze, and <span>temperatures</span> averaging around <span>-224 degrees Celsius (-371 degrees Fahrenheit)</span>, making it one of the coldest planets in the solar system.</span>

                <span>
                    <span>Uranus lacks a solid surface</span>; thus, it has <span>no traditional geological features</span> like mountains or valleys. Its <span>structure</span> comprises an <span>icy and rocky core</span>, possibly surrounded by a <span>mantle</span> of <span>icy materials</span> like water, methane, and ammonia. The extreme pressure and temperatures within Uranus might create an interior where <span>water exists as a hot, high-pressure form of ice</span>. This unique composition contributes to its magnetic field generation and might <span>cause unusual phenomena like diamond rain</span>, where carbon might crystallize into diamonds due to immense pressure deep within the planet.</span>

                <span>COMPOSITION</span>
                <span>
                    <span>Uranus</span> consists mainly of <span>hydrogen (around 75%)</span> and <span>helium (approximately 25%)</span> similar to Jupiter and Saturn. However, it differs significantly due to its <span>methane-rich atmosphere</span>, which gives the planet its <span>bluish tint</span>. Beneath the atmosphere lies a mantle composed of water, ammonia, and methane ices surrounding a rocky core, contributing to its unique composition and potential for <span>exotic forms of ice</span> under extreme pressure and temperature.</span>
