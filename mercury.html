                <span>ATMOSPHERE</span>
                <span>Mercury's atmosphere is extremely thin and composed mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, and helium. Due to its proximity to the sun and weak gravity, the solar wind strips away its atmosphere. Surface temperatures fluctuate wildly, ranging from -290째F (-180째C) to 800째F (430째C) due to its lack of atmosphere to retain heat. This extreme temperature variation and the absence of a substantial atmosphere make Mercury's environment inhospitable for sustaining life.</span>

                <span>Mercury's geology is marked by extensive cratering, akin to the Moon, due to impacts from asteroids and comets. It possesses vast plains, scarps (cliffs), and ridges caused by contraction as its iron core cooled, causing the surface to shrink. Unique features include volcanic plains formed by ancient volcanic activity, evidenced by smooth, dark basaltic plains called "maria." Mercury's heavily cratered surface indicates billions of years of geological history, revealing a planet shaped by intense bombardment and geological processes, despite its small size.</span>

                    Mercury's composition predominantly comprises a metallic core, making up about 60% of its mass, rich in iron and nickel. Its rocky mantle and crust consist of silicate minerals like feldspar and pyroxene. Additionally, it contains elements such as sulfur, oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, and helium in trace amounts. This composition results in its high density and distinctive surface features, showcasing a mix of rocky terrain, impact craters, and volcanic plains across the planet's surface.</span>
